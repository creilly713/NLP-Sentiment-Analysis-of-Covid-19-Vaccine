This project aimed to determine the public opinion on the Covid-19 vaccines in 2021 and 2022. Tweets were collected from Twitter (now called X) that contained one or more pre-selected buzz words which relate to the Covid-19 vaccines. Words such as "covid vaccine", "Pfizer vaccine" and "covid-19 vaccination" are prime examples of buzzwords the text scrping tools look for in harvesting tweets for this study.
3 different datasets of tweets were used in the study, the first a publically available collection of almost 400,000 Covid-19 Tweets from Kaggle (user gpreda), the second a dataset of 11,000 tweets sourced from Canvas, and a final dataset of 365,000 tweets I scraped from Twitter using the Python module sntwitter.

Before analysis the datasets were cleaned and preprocessed. Text preparation procedures such as removal of stop words and puncuation marks along with converting all text to the same lower case were carried out. The text was then Tokenised and Lemminised, which is a crucial step in formatting the text in the required form for sentiment analysis software.

The data mining and cleaning steps are available in the "Canvas Dataset Cleaning", "Kaggle Dataset Cleaning" and "Web-Scraped Dataset Cleaning" repositories.

"Sentiment Analysis" displays the code for conducting the sentiment analysis studies. The NLP toolkit TextBlob was used for determining the sentiment of the datasets. The results of the study were consistent across all 3 datasets with the most common sentiment determined to be Neutral and Positive.
